\chapter{Quantum Finite Automata}
\label{chap:quantum-finite-automata}

The study of \glspl{qfa} arose from the question of how far the
finite-memory paradigm of \glspl{cfa} extends when the transition
map is replaced by symbol-controlled unitary operators followed by
quantum measurement. Since the seminal formulations of measure-once and
measure-many one-way machines \cite{kondacs1997power,
moore2000quantum}, this minimalist model has revealed capabilities
that distinguish it sharply from its deterministic counterpart; examples
include exponential state savings in promise-problem recognition
\cite{ambainis19981} and interactive proof power that eludes
classical finite verifiers of identical size \cite{nishimura2009application}.

This chapter offers a concise taxonomy that tracks the historical
broadening of the model while keeping a uniform notation. We begin with
the foundational one-way variants, then investigate how two-way head
motion, hybrid quantum-classical control or bounded counters enlarge the
language classes recognised, occasionally reaching beyond the regular
languages \cite{brodsky2002characterizations,ambainis2002two,zheng2012one}. The survey closes with less common
frameworks, such as postselection, promise settings and $\omega$-word machines, 
that continue to challenge classical intuitions
\cite{aaronson2005quantum,scegulnaja2010postselection,bhatia2019quantum}.

Throughout the discussion each device is specified as a fixed-size tuple
whose components highlight the role of the quantum state space, the
observable structure and the head movement policy. Key results on
expressive power, closure properties and decidability are presented, culminating in a comparative
table that juxtaposes state complexity bounds and closure behaviour
across all surveyed models. This structured overview equips the reader
with the precise vocabulary and conceptual tools required for the later
translation of \glspl{qfa} into executable quantum circuits developed in
Chapter\,\ref{chap:automata-to-circuits}.
