  abstract = {To study quantum computation, it might be helpful to generalize structures from language and automata theory to the quantum case. To that end, we propose quantum versions of finite-state and push-down automata, and regular and context-free grammars. We find analogs of several classical theorems, including pumping lemmas, closure properties, rational and algebraic generating functions, and Greibach normal form. We also show that there are quantum context-free languages that are not context-free, so QCFL≠CFL.}

  abstract = {The 2-way quantum finite automaton introduced by Kondacs and Watrous [Proceedings of the 38th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 1997, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 66--75] can accept nonregular languages with bounded error in polynomial time. If we restrict the head of the automaton to moving classically and to moving only in one direction, the acceptance power of this 1-way quantum finite automaton is reduced to a proper subset of the regular languages.In this paper we study two different models of 1-way quantum finite automata. The first model, termed measure-once quantum finite automata, was introduced by Moore and Crutchfield [Theoret. Comput. Sci., 237 (2000), pp. 275--306], and the second model, termed measure-many quantum finite automata, was introduced by Kondacs and Watrous [Proceedings of the38th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 1997, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 66--75].We characterize the measure-once model when it is restricted to accepting with bounded error and show that, without that restriction, it can solve the word problem over the free group. We also show that it can be simulated by a probabilistic finite automaton and describe an algorithm that determines if two measure-once automata are equivalent.We prove several closure properties of the classes of languages accepted by measure-many automata, including inverse homomorphisms, and provide a new necessary condition for a language to be accepted by the measure-many model with bounded error. Finally, we show that piecewise testable sets can be accepted with bounded error by a measure-many quantum finite automaton, introducing new construction techniques for quantum automata in the process. }

  abstract={Quantum finite automata can be used for pattern recognition. Present implementations on actual quantum devices face decoherence issues, which compromise the quality of long strings computation. In this work, we focus on the Measure Once 1-way Quantum Finite Automata (MO1QFA) model for addressing the MOD^p problem, investigating how quantum errors may affect the quality of the computation in this model when implemented in IBM-Q superconducting environment. To improve the performance of the implementation, we use pulse-level programming for calibrating a fast single-qubit gate designed specifically for the automaton implementation. The demonstrations conducted on the Jakarta quantum computer show that using custom pulses significantly reduces errors during extended word computations. While realizing improvements in error variations and predictability -- with a fourfold reduction in circuit latency -- the proposed solution demonstrates a substantial increase in the supported computation length of the automaton. When considering thresholds of 10% and 20% in absolute errors of acceptance probabilities, the solution has the potential to increase the maximum word length by 12 and 7+ times, respectively, compared to the default Qiskit gate.}

For such automata the acceptance of an input is quantified with a probability. There are plenty of results in the literature addressing the complexity of checking the equivalence of these automata, that is, checking whether two automata accept all inputs with the same probability. On the other hand, the critical problem of finding the minimal automata equivalent to a given one has been left open [C. Moore, J.P. Crutchfield, Quantum automata and quantum grammars, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 237 (2000) 275–306, see p. 304, Problem 5]. In this work, we reduce the minimization problem of probabilistic and quantum automata to finding a solution of a system of algebraic polynomial (in)equations. An EXPSPACE upper bound on the complexity of the minimization problem is derived by applying Renegarʼs algorithm. More specifically, we show that the state minimization of probabilistic automata, measure-once quantum automata, measure-many quantum automata, measure-once generalized quantum automata, and measure-many generalized quantum automata is decidable and in EXPSPACE. Finally, we also solve an open problem concerning minimal covering of stochastic sequential machines [A. Paz, Introduction to Probabilistic Automata, Academic Press, New York, 1971, p. 43].}

First we elaborate on a variant of their semantics that can be obtained through a shift from the Schr{\"o}dinger to the Heisenberg picture of Quantum Mechanics. In the Schr{\"o}dinger picture states evolve in time while observables remain constant, while in the Heisenberg one states are constant and observables evolve. Interestingly, in the case of a QFA such shift reverts time-evolution. However, the equivalence of the two pictures over the class of QFAs holds thanks to the closure of the class with respect to language mirroring. Since the expressive power of such class of automata remains limited to infinite languages, we then consider their extension with bounded (multi-letter QFAs) and unbounded memory. Unfortunately, while bounded memory enhances the expressive power, the unbounded memory approach does not behave as one would expect.",

To process input words, the automaton exploits the degree of polarization of single photons and, to reduce the acceptance error probability, a technique of confidence amplification using the photon counts is implemented. In this paper, we show that the performance of this automaton may be further improved by using strategies that suitably consider both the orthogonal output polarizations of the photon. In our analysis, we also take into account how detector dark counts may affect the performance of the automaton.},

The approach is essentially generalized from the work of Carlyle [J.W. Carlyle, Reduced forms for stochastic sequential machines, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 7 (1963) 167–175]. Namely, we reduce the equivalence problem of MM-1QFAs to that of two (initial) vectors. As an application of the approach, we utilize it to address the equivalence problem of enhanced one-way quantum finite automata (E-1QFAs) introduced by Nayak [A. Nayak, Optimal lower bounds for quantum automata and random access codes, in: Proceedings of the 40th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 1999, pp. 369–376]. We prove that two E-1QFAs A1 and A2 over Σ are equivalence if and only if they are n12+n22−1-equivalent where n1 and n2 are the numbers of states in A1 and A2, respectively. As an important consequence, we obtain that it is decidable whether or not L(A1)=L(A2) where L(A)⊆Σ⁎ denotes the set recognizable by MM-1QFA A (or by E-1QFA A) with cutpoint (or with non-strict cutpoint).

In this paper, we study a generalized model named one-way general quantum finite automata (1gQFA), in which each symbol in the input alphabet induces a trace-preserving quantum operation, instead of a unitary transformation. Two different kinds of 1gQFA will be studied: measure-once one-way general quantum finite automata (MO-1gQFA) where a measurement deciding to accept or reject is performed at the end of a computation, and measure-many one-way general quantum finite automata (MM-1gQFA) where a similar measurement is performed after each trace-preserving quantum operation on reading each input symbol. We characterize the measure-once model from three aspects: the closure property, the language recognition power, and the equivalence problem. We prove that MO-1gQFA recognize, with bounded error, precisely the set of all regular languages. Our results imply that some models of quantum finite automata proposed in the literature, which were expected to be more powerful, still cannot recognize non-regular languages. We prove that MM-1gQFA also recognize only regular languages with bounded error. Thus, MM-1gQFA and MO-1gQFA have the same language recognition power, in sharp contrast with traditional MO-1QFA and MM-1QFA, the former being strictly less powerful than the latter. Finally, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for two MM-1gQFA to be equivalent.}

  abstract = {Interactive proof systems (IP) are very powerful – languages they can accept form exactly PSPACE. They represent also one of the very fundamental concepts of theoretical computing and a model of computation by interactions. One of the key players in IP is verifier. In the original model of IP whose power is that of PSPACE, the only restriction on verifiers is that they work in randomized polynomial time. Because of such key importance of IP, it is of large interest to find out how powerful will IP be when verifiers are more restricted. So far this was explored for the case that verifiers are two-way probabilistic finite automata (Dwork and Stockmeyer, 1990) and one-way quantum finite automata as well as two-way quantum finite automata (Nishimura and Yamakami, 2009). IP in which verifiers use public randomization is called Arthur–Merlin proof systems (AM). AM with verifiers modeled by Turing Machines augmented with a fixed-size quantum register (qAM) were studied also by Yakaryilmaz (2012). He proved, for example, that an NP-complete language Lknapsack, representing the 0–1 knapsack problem, can be recognized by a qAM whose verifier is a two-way finite automaton working on quantum mixed states using superoperators. In this paper we explore the power of AM for the case that verifiers are two-way finite automata with quantum and classical states (2QCFA) – introduced by Ambainis and Watrous in 2002 – and the communications are classical. It is of interest to consider AM with such “semi-quantum” verifiers because they use only limited quantum resources. Our main result is that such Quantum Arthur–Merlin proof systems (QAM(2QCFA)) with polynomial expected running time are more powerful than the models in which the verifiers are two-way probabilistic finite automata (AM(2PFA)) with polynomial expected running time. Moreover, we prove that there is a language which can be recognized by an exponential expected running time QAM(2QCFA), but cannot be recognized by any AM(2PFA), and that the NP-complete language Lknapsack can also be recognized by a QAM(2QCFA) working only on quantum pure states using unitary operators.}

This paper seeks their direct application to interactive proof systems in which a mighty quantum prover communicates with a quantum-automaton verifier through a common communication cell. Our quantum interactive proof systems are juxtaposed to Dwork–Stockmeyer's classical interactive proof systems whose verifiers are two-way probabilistic finite automata. We demonstrate strengths and weaknesses of our systems by studying how various restrictions on the behaviors of quantum-automaton verifiers affect the power of quantum interactive proof systems.}

As a follow-up to the authors' early journal publication [J. Comput. System Sci., vol. 75, pp. 255–269, 2009], we further investigate the quantum nature of interactions between provers and verifiers by studying how various restrictions on quantum interactive proof systems affect the language recognition power of the proof systems. In particular, we examine three intriguing restrictions that (i) provers always behave in a classical fashion, (ii) verifiers always reveal to provers the information on their next moves, and (iii) the number of interactions between provers and verifiers is bounded.}

  abstract = {In the literature, there exist several interesting hybrid models of quantum finite automata (QFA) which have both quantum and classical states. This paper describes these models in a uniform way: a hybrid QFA can be seen as a two-component communication system consisting of a quantum component and a classical one, and the existing hybrid QFA differ from each other mainly in the specific communication pattern: classical-quantum, or quantum-classical, or two-way. We clarify the relationship between these hybrid QFA and some other models; in particular, it is shown that hybrid QFA can be simulated exactly by QFA with general quantum operations. As corollaries, some results in the literature concerning the language recognition power and the equivalence problem of hybrid QFA follow directly from these relationships clarified in this paper.}
