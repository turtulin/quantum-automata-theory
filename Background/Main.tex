\chapter{Background}  
\label{chap:background}
This chapter provides the theoretical and mathematical foundations that connect classical models of computation with quantum information theory, structured around three central domains: classical automata theory, finite-dimensional quantum mechanics, and the gate-based framework of quantum circuits.

We begin by reviewing the algebra of formal languages and the computational limitations and expressiveness of \glspl{cfa}. The section formalises \glspl{dfa}, \glspl{nfa}, \glspl{pfa}, and \glspl{2fa}, examining their closure properties, characterisation of \glspl{reg}, and algebraic structure, which together form a foundational framework for the study of automaton-based computation \cite{hopcroft2001introduction}.

Next, we present the finite-dimensional postulates of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. This section covers the fundamental ideas of superposition, entanglement, the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement, and the encoding of information in qubits and quantum states in the context of quantum dynamics, which includes unitary evolution governed by the Schr√∂dinger equation and the handling of decoherence and open systems via density matrices.
The exposition follows the axiomatic approach developed by Dirac and von Neumann \cite{dirac1981principles,von2018mathematical}, with particular emphasis on features pertinent to quantum automata, including projective measurements, the no-cloning theorem, and the compositional structure of subsystems \cite{wootters1982single}.

The gate-based circuit model of quantum computation is covered in the last section. It reviews common quantum gates, families of circuits (including parameterised and measurement-based circuits), the implementation of quantum algorithms, and the decomposition of arbitrary unitary operations into standard gate sets \cite{weinberg1995quantum,fedoriaka2025decomposition}. The circuit-level realisation of \glspl{qfa} covered in later chapters is based on these ideas.

Together, these three pillars form the theoretical foundation upon which the thesis develops its unified treatment of \glspl{qfa}, their taxonomy, and their compilation into executable circuits.
