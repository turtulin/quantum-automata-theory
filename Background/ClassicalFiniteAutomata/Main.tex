\label{sec:classical-finite-automata} 

Finite automata form the cornerstone of formal language theory, providing mathematical frameworks for analyzing computational limits and language recognition capabilities. This section systematically examines \glspl{dfa}, \glspl{nfa}, \glspl{pfa}, and two-way variants such as \glspl{2dfa}, \glspl{2nfa}, and \glspl{2pfa}, emphasizing their structural relationships, operational dynamics, and computational boundaries. These classical models not only define the limits of traditional computation but also serve as a benchmark for more advanced paradigms, including quantum automata. Importantly, a primary goal of this review is to clearly identify the exact classes of languages each automaton model accepts.
