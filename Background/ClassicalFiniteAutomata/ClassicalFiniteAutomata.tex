\section{Classical Finite Automata}
\label{sec:classical-finite-automata} 

Finite automata form the cornerstone of formal language theory, providing mathematical frameworks to analyze computational limits and language recognition capabilities. This section systematically examines \gls{dfa}, \gls{nfa}, \gls{pfa}, and two-way variants, emphasizing their structural relationships and computational boundaries. These classical models not only define the limits of traditional computation but also serve as a benchmark for more advanced computational paradigms, including quantum automata.
