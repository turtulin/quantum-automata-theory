\section{Quantum Mechanics Foundations}
\label{sec:quantum-foundations}

This section establishes the quantum mechanical principles that underpin quantum automata theory. We emphasise both the mathematical formalism and the conceptual distinctions from classical systems. In what follows, we review the basic postulates of quantum mechanics, elaborate on the structure and evolution of quantum states, and discuss measurement, decoherence, and their computational implications.
