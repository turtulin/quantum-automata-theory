\subsection{Additional Remarks: Unitary Evolution and Quantum Dynamics}
\label{subsec:unitary_evolution}

In a closed quantum system the evolution is governed by the Schr√∂dinger equation,
\[
i\hbar \frac{d}{dt} |\psi(t)\rangle = H |\psi(t)\rangle,
\]
where \(H\) is the Hamiltonian of the system. The formal solution is given by
\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = U(t)|\psi(0)\rangle,\quad \text{with } U(t)=e^{-iHt/\hbar},
\]
and \(U(t)\) is a unitary operator. In quantum circuits, the discrete analog of this continuous evolution is realized by sequences of quantum gates.

The \textbf{no-cloning theorem} is another foundational result stating that it is impossible to create an identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. This principle has deep implications for quantum information processing and quantum cryptography.
