The foundations of quantum mechanics—qubits, superposition, entanglement, unitary evolution, measurement, and decoherence—form the bedrock upon which quantum automata theory is built. Understanding these principles is crucial for grasping how quantum automata differ from their classical counterparts and how quantum effects can be harnessed to achieve computational advantages.
