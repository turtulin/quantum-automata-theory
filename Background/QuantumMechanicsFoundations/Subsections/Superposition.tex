\subsection{Superposition and Entanglement}
\label{subsec:superposition}

\begin{definition}[Superposition]
\emph{Superposition} is the principle that a quantum state may exist as a linear combination of basis states. This property enables quantum systems to be in multiple configurations simultaneously and is central to the power of quantum algorithms.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Hadamard Transformation]
    \label{ex:hadamard}
Applying the Hadamard gate \(H\) to the basis state \(|0\rangle\) creates a uniform superposition:
\[
H|0\rangle = \frac{|0\rangle + |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad H|1\rangle = \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Entanglement]
\emph{Entanglement} is a uniquely quantum phenomenon where the state of a composite system cannot be expressed as a product of the states of its individual subsystems. In such cases, the measurement outcomes on one subsystem are intrinsically correlated with those on another.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Bell States]
The \textbf{Bell states} are examples of maximally entangled two-qubit states:
\[
|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{|00\rangle + |11\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad
|\Phi^-\rangle = \frac{|00\rangle - |11\rangle}{\sqrt{2}},
\]
\[
|\Psi^+\rangle = \frac{|01\rangle + |10\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad
|\Psi^-\rangle = \frac{|01\rangle - |10\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Multipartite Entangled States]
    Important multipartite entangled states include the \gls{ghz} state and the W state:
    \[
    |\text{GHZ}\rangle = \frac{|000\rangle + |111\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad
    |W\rangle = \frac{|001\rangle + |010\rangle + |100\rangle}{\sqrt{3}}.
    \]
    These states are essential for applications in quantum communication and quantum error correction \cite{greenberger1990bell}.
\end{example}

\begin{observation}
    Entanglement is the resource behind many quantum protocols such as quantum teleportation \cite{bennett1993teleporting} and superdense coding, and it plays a pivotal role in the computational speedup promised by algorithms like Shor's factorization algorithm \cite{shor1994algorithms}.
\end{observation}
