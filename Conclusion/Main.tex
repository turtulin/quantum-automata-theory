This study has revisited the theoretical foundations and the practical compilation of \glspl{qfa}. Starting from a detailed taxonomy that unifies over thirty years of scattered literature, we framed the principal one-way variants, namely the \gls{mo-1qfa} and the \gls{mm-1qfa}, within a single terminology. The resulting classification clarifies relations among models and supplies a consistent language for future analyses.

Building on that framework, we introduced a compilation pipeline that translates high-level \gls{qfa} specifications into architecture-independent quantum circuits. The pipeline separates template generation from parameter instantiation: templates encode the automaton structure once, whereas numerical parameters are loaded either offline or at run time. This separation permits the execution of \glspl{qfa} on present \gls{nisq} devices without sacrificing portability or reusability.

By producing executable gate-level designs for both \glspl{mo-1qfa} and \glspl{mm-1qfa}, the thesis bridges finite-memory language recognisers and quantum software stacks. The approach advances theoretical understanding of automaton-to-circuit translation and delivers practical tools for embedding quantum recognisers into larger workflows, such as verification and pattern-matching tasks.

Future investigations may target two-way and hybrid automata, automated minimisation, and quantitative studies of expressive trade-offs in quantum-classical hybrids. The convergence of automata theory and circuit design outlined here reinforces the position of \glspl{qfa} as foundational elements of quantum computing and opens avenues for systematic, automata-driven programming on forthcoming hardware generations.
