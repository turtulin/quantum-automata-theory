This thesis has established a unified framework for the analysis of quantum finite automata by rigorously formalizing both classical automata models and their quantum counterparts. The work began with precise definitions and characterizations of classical models such as deterministic finite automata (DFAs), nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), and probabilistic finite automata (PFAs), and then extended these concepts to a variety of quantum finite automata (QFA) models. In doing so, a systematic taxonomy was developed that organizes one-way models (e.g., MO-1QFA, MM-1QFA, 1QFAC) and two-way models (e.g., 2QFA, 2QCFA) in terms of their state complexity, language recognition capabilities, and error bounds.

The research results demonstrate that quantum finite automata can offer significant advantages over classical models, such as exponential state savings and improved recognition of certain non-regular languages under bounded error. Detailed comparisons of closure properties, decidability issues, and the effects of decoherence have been provided, offering quantitative insights that can inform both theoretical investigations and practical applications. These outcomes contribute a solid formal foundation to the field and may serve as a basis for designing efficient quantum algorithms and optimizing quantum circuit implementations.

Future work should address several promising directions. One key area is the rigorous exploration of the equivalence between quantum automata and quantum circuit models. Investigations into whether quantum automata can be compiled into quantum circuits (and vice versa) will deepen our understanding of quantum computational processes. Additional research is needed to refine error-correction techniques for hybrid models and to extend the taxonomy to cover interactive, multi-tape, and resource-constrained quantum systems. Addressing the decidability of equivalence problems and developing practical compilation techniques remain important challenges for advancing both theory and implementation in quantum computing.
