\section{\glsentrylong{moqfa} to Circuit}
\label{sec:moqfa}

This section describes the \glsentryfull{moqfa} model, which is a generalisation of the \glsentryfull{mmqfa} model. The \glsentrylong{moqfa} model is defined in a similar way to the \glsentrylong{mmqfa} model, but it allows for multiple measurements at each state. This section will cover the definition of the \glsentrylong{moqfa} model, its acceptance conditions, and its properties.
