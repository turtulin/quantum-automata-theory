\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{chap:literature-review}

This chapter reviews the literature on \glspl{qfa}, juxtaposing the quantum models with their classical counterparts. We discuss \gls{1qfa} and \gls{2qfa} models, hybrid variants that combine classical control with quantum operations, enhanced models employing mixed states and open-system dynamics, as well as interactive, generalised and abstract \glspl{qfa}. We also consider specialised \gls{qfa} variants designed for specific tasks, such as promise problems and language recognition. 
For each model, we present formal definitions, operational descriptions, key features, language acceptance properties, and known limitations. Throughout, a homogeneous notation is employed: quantum states are represented as kets (e.g. \( |q\rangle \)), transition functions are expressed in either unitary or superoperator forms, and the state sets (e.g. \( Q_{acc} \), \( Q_{rej} \), \( Q_{non} \)) are uniformly denoted.
