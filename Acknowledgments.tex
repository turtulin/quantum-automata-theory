\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

Above all, this journey has been immensely rewarding, even though it was demanding and at times exhausting.

Since I began my studies at the University of Camerino, Michele Loreti has remained a steady mentor, and I am deeply grateful for his guidance.

I also value Marcello Bonsangue's generosity, openness, constant good humour, and sharp feedback.

Thank you to the LIACS staff and PhD students for creating a friendly and engaging environment. You made every day interesting and enjoyable, from lively whiteboard sessions to endless coffee breaks.

To my family: thank you for your steady support and for always being there. Mum, you have been my unfailing reference in all matters, ready with practical advice and help whenever I needed it.

To my friends in Camerino: thank you for turning that small town into the centre of the universe. A special shout-out to Alice, my anchor during the toughest moments.

Valentijn, thank you for making my time in the Netherlands even lovelier and for giving me a sense of home there. You stood by me during those life-changing months, bringing peace and calm when I needed them most.

I'm grateful to everyone I've met. Whether you encouraged me or pushed me, you influenced who I am today.

Lastly, I want to thank the version of me who set out on this adventure three years ago. Even without a clear destination, you kept your energy, curiosity, and resolve. I'm proud of who you've become; it was hard, but it was worth it.
