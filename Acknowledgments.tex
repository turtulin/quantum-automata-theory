\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
This adventure has been very rewarding, even though it was challenging and sometimes exhausting.

Firstly, I want to thank Michele Loreti, who has been a constant mentor to me, and Marcello Bonsangue for his kindness, constant smile, and insigthful feedback.

Thank you to the LIACS staff and PhD students for creating a friendly and engaging environment. You made every day interesting and enjoyable, from lively whiteboard sessions to endless coffee breaks.

I want to thank my family for always being there. Mum, you have been my reference in all matters, ready with practical advice and help whenever I needed it.

I also want to express my gratitude to my friends in Camerino for turning that small town into the centre of the universe. I would especially like to thank Alice, who not only supported me through difficult times but also brought me joy every time, no matter how anxious I was.

Valentijn, thank you for making my time in the Netherlands feel truly like home. You gave me a sense of belonging that was more than just comforting, like the missing piece in a future I was only starting to imagine. You stood by me during these life-changing months, bringing peace and calm when I needed them most.

I am grateful to everyone I have met. Whether you pushed or supported me, you shaped who I am now.

Lastly, I want to thank the version of me who set out on this adventure three years ago. Even without a clear destination, you kept your energy, curiosity, and resolve. I'm proud of who you've become; it was hard, but it was worth it.
